  * mcc/Makefile.#?: reworked all makefiles to also compile the TheBarVirt.mcc
    class on a normal make operation.
  * mcc, mccv: removed the 'mccv' directory and its whole sources as they were
    completly identical to the one of the mcc instead of the "#ifdef VIRTUAL"
    statements. However, there were no real reason to keep two identical copies
    of the same sources. So they are now unified and the 'mccv' directory
    completly removed.

  * mcc: the source do compile for OS3 and MOS again. Also the test application
    seems to work fine for the moment. So lets see how the MCC behaves with all
    the demo's included. But we seem to get quite fare for now.
  * mcc/TheBar-Test.c:  fixed the test application to not crash upon exit and
    also set the PicsDir so that the images are loaded correctly if executed
    within the respository hierarchy.
  * mcc: added debugging output to all involved functions so that our further
    work gets a bit more easier when developing on TheBar.mcc

2006-12-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc: some more general cleanup of definitions and used files.
  * mcc: removed all "register" definitions as there is really no reason
    to set all kind of variables explicitly as register. The compiler should
    decide which value to directly put on a register and which not. Just
    defining every variable "register" doesn't help at all.

2006-11-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc/TheBar-Test.c: added new testing application which should allow to
    directly run tests on TheBar.mcc without having to update the library,
    reboot and run the tests. Now the testing application will directly
    link against all MCC modules and as such acts as a standalone application.
    That might come really handy at some point.

2006-11-29  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mcc, include: ported MCC sources to the generalized mccheader.c
    framework and added GNU makefiles for all three mainly supported
    targets (OS3/OS4/MOS). SAS/C compilation should now be considered
    obsolete as we want to concentrate on getting everything running
    with GCC instead. However, please note that the MCC sources just
    compile and link now. The porting is still largly untested but
    should soonish end up in a usable state hopefully.
  * misc: applied latest changes supplied by Alfonso.

2006-11-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * converted old CVS repository to sf.net based SVN

2005-11-30  Alfonso Ranieri <alforan@tin.it>

  * released sources under LGPL at sf.net
