TheBar.mcc is a MUI custom class for Amiga systems for management of multiple
buttons in a toolbar-like environment. It allows to group multiple button together,
allows to hide/sleep/disable a specific button as well as send notifications in
case a button was pressed by the user. It features a multitude of different
settings and the majority of these are configurable for the user via the MUI
preferences system.

TheBar.mcc class was originally developed by Alfonso Ranieri. Since November
2005 it was released under the LGPL license and is now freely available and
further developed by an independent open source developer group.

TheBar.mcc is available for AmigaOS3, AmigaOS4, MorphOS and AROS.
