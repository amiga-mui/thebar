TheBar.mcc is a MUI custom class for management of multiple buttons in a
toolbar-like environment. It allows to group multiple button together, allows
to hide/sleep/disable a specific button as well as send notifications in case
a button was pressed by the user. It features a multitude of different
settings and the majority of these are configurable for the user via the MUI
preferences system.

2005 it was released under the LGPL license and is now freely available and
further developed by an independent open source developer group.

TheBar.mcc is available for OS3, OS4, MorphOS and AROS.

The TheBar.mcc class project is hosted on SourceForge. Its project
name is "thebar".
